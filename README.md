  <b>✈️ AeroData Flight Price Prediction Project</b>
</h1>

This project is a submission for the **AeroData Data Science Competition**.  
It includes a **complete machine learning pipeline** to predict **Indian domestic flight prices** and an **interactive web application** to demonstrate the model's performance.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  

The primary objective is to build a **high-performance regression model** that accurately predicts flight ticket prices based on features such as:  

- 🛫 Airline  
- 📅 Date of Journey  
- 🌍 Source & Destination  
- ⏱ Duration  
- 🔁 Number of Stops  

The project is structured into two main parts:  

1. **Model Training** – [`flight_price_prediction_final.py`](flight_price_prediction_final.py.py)  
   - Handles **data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation**.  
   - Outputs a serialized model file (`flight_price_model.pkl`).  

2. **Web Application** – [`streamlit_app.py`](./streamlit_app.py)  
   - An **interactive web app** built with **Streamlit**.  
   - Loads the trained model and allows users to get **real-time flight price predictions** by entering flight details.

## 🛠️ How to Run This Project  

### ✅ Prerequisites  

Make sure **Python 3** is installed, then install dependencies:  

```
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn streamlit
```

📌 Step 1: Train the Prediction Model

Run the training script to preprocess data and create flight_price_model.pkl:
```
python flight_price_prediction_final.py
```

This script will print performance metrics:

R² Score

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

and save the trained model as flight_price_model.pkl.

📌 Step 2: Launch the Interactive Web App

Once the model is saved, run the Streamlit app:
```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
👉 This will open a browser tab where you can enter flight details and click "Predict Price" to see results.
